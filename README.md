A node script to get the top post for a given subreddit and set it as your desktop background.

Images are saved the to `images/` folder in the project directory.

## Acknowledgement

[Wallpaper](https://github.com/sindresorhus/wallpaper) does all of the heavy lifting. This just hits the reddit api and calls wallpaper to set the background.
